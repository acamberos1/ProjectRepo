first draft of project
- text adventure game where the controllable character explores different areas to find a way home ( a cabin? or city?)
- user will have to use objects which need classes and will change the ending the user gets.
- each area has different descriptions, each area may have its own unique objects that can be reached.
- 3 different endings is the current goal, may change later
- will have npc, currently unsure if i can and/or should give them a class to have more interactability.
- 4 to 5 areas initially
- give the character HP?????
